Idea- Selfie Image Polling Platform(SIPP)

What's that? Let's Explore it.

As the name suggests, it will be a platform that ranks people's selfie based on the vote. People loves taking the selfie but more importantly, when they win in a participation, the real joy is there. This Platform provides both together i.e., click selfie + competitive with other selfie lovers. 
                  Wait, not only this, I have more things to make this app interesting. How?. Let's see. If we competitive peoples region wise(Global, National, State, District, subdistrict or smaller level). Every people wants to win and level-wise competition will surely change the mindset of the people and he/she will surely take part in. Even, this platform doesn't need media coverage, people will automatically engage our app to other people.

## Source of Inspiration-
You might see the people competing with each other and saying "My pic is better than you" for winning the Title of -Best Pic or Best DP or whatever. This happens anytime and anywhere.
